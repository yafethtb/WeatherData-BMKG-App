# AS PER LATEST VERSION I'VE CHECKED FROM THE BMKG WEBSITE (APRIL, 2025), THERE ARE A LOT OF CHANGES IN ITS DESIGN AND THEY MAKE THIS PROJECT OBSOLETE. I CHOOSE TO 'RETIRE' THIS PROJECT INSTEAD OF MAINTAINING IT. THE CHANGES MADE IN THE HTML CODES INCLUDING THE USE OF JAVASCRIPT, SOMETHING THAT LIBRARY LIKE `BeautifulSoup` CAN'T HANDLE.
